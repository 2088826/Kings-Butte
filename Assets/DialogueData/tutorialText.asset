  - 'Hail, my liege! I doth perceive thou art preparing to lay claim to that which
    is thy rightful due: The BUTTE...'
  - But first thou shall need to learn how to move...
  - "To maneuver around,  employ [A, W, S, D], or the [D-Pad] of thy controller. 
    \r\n"
  - Furthermore, thy royal scepter holds the power to propel thee aloft, higher than
    any other.
  - To achieve such feat, employ [Arrow Keys] or [Right Joystick] to aim thy jump,
    and [Space Bar] or [L1] to enact the leap.
  - Excellent, my liege! Let us now proceed to the offensive!
  - To pound thine foes press [Q] or [R1].
  - Marvelous! But thou seek to smite from a greater distance and crush thine enemies.
  - Take aim with [Arrow Keys] or [Right joystick] and unleash a focused assault
    with the press of [R2].
  - 'Good.. Good.. '
  - To defeat the usurpers thou shall need to push them off The BUTTE. Give it a
    try. Move to the enemy and banish them from your kingdom.
  - At times, certain items shall manifest within the realm. To employ their abilities,
    simply press [Shift] or [L2].
  - Have at it, then! Go forth and seize an item, and press [Shift] or [L2] to activate
    its power.
  - 'Magnificent, my lord! Verily, thou art now prepared to do battle upon The BUTTE. '
  - However, I would advise thee to remain vigilant, for obstacles shall surely obstruct
    thy path. Best of luck in thy quest for the crown!
